# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Native Advanced Todo Console App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (In Scope / Out of Scope defined)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Validation Summary**:
- Content Quality: All items pass. Specification focuses on user needs and business value without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or APIs.
- Requirement Completeness: All 25 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. 8 user stories defined with acceptance scenarios. Edge cases identified. Scope boundaries clearly defined.
- Feature Readiness: Every functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria. No implementation details present.

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.
- All constitution requirements (9 features) are covered in user stories.
- Spec maintains alignment with constitution principles while remaining implementation-agnostic.
- No clarifications needed - all assumptions are reasonable and documented.
